        Layouts introduction.
        
        Layout means the way things or UI Elements are 
        rendered in the browser.

        There are a few types of layouts that we have:

        1) block. (default)
        2) inline.
        3) inline-block.
        4) flex.
        5) grid.
        6) none.

        Block:
        => occupy all available space.
        => begin with a new line.

        examples = div, section, header

        Inline Elements:

        => inline elements only take as much space as thier content
        => they do not force a line break
        => they do not allow, width and height setting
        
        examples = span, a, strong

        Inline-Block:

        => Behave like inline elements, but allow width
         and height settings.
        => Useful for aliginig items without breaking the line

        The layout in css is set by the display property.

        for example =>
        
        display: inline;
        or
        display: inline-block;



        Flexbox:

        => Flex box is a uni-directional or one dimensional table 
        => it can have one row multiple columns or 
        one column multiple rows.
        => flexbox is set by the css property display: flex 
        => all children of a flexbox container automatically 
        become flex items
        => a flexbox container's direct children's displayproperty is automatically set to flex
        => flexboxes' direction is set by flex-direction 
        => justify-content property sets main axis alignment
        => align-items property sets cross axis alignment

        (main axis means the property you have set using
        flex direction, if it is row then main axis is the 
        x axis and cross axis is the y axis and vice versa)
